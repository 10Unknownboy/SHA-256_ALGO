| Step | Calculation |
| :-- | :-- |
| (T_1) | (h + \Sigma_1(e) + Ch(e, f, g) + k_t + w_t) |
| (T_2) | (\Sigma_0(a) + Maj(a, b, c)) |
| Update | (h = g), (g = f), (f = e), (e = d + T_1), (d = c), (c = b), (b = a), (a = T_1 + T_2) |

### üî¢ Example Calculation for (w_{16})

- (w_{16} = \sigma_1(w_{14}) + w_9 + \sigma_0(w_1) + w_0 \mod 2^{32})
- Given many of these (w_i) are zero, the calculation simplifies.
- Bitwise operations and modulo addition ensure (w_{16}) remains 32 bits.

### üîÅ Step 8: Final Hash Value Update

- After completing all 64 rounds, update the hash values:

[ h_i = h_i + working variable_i \quad for i=0 ¬∑¬∑¬∑ 7 ]
