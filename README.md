### üéµ Overview of SHA-256 Hashing Process for Input "red block blue"

- The input string is a sequence of characters to be hashed using SHA-256.
- The explanation covers each step from converting input to binary through to producing the final hash output.

***

### üî¢ Step 1: ASCII to Binary Conversion

- Each character in the input is converted to its ASCII binary equivalent (8 bits per character).
- For the 12 characters in "red block blue", this results in a 96-bit binary string.
- These bits are concatenated into one long binary string.
- The bits are then prepared for pre-processing and padding.

***

### üß© Step 2: Pre-processing and Padding

- SHA-256 requires input length to be a multiple of 512 bits.
- Current input length: 96 bits.
- Round up to nearest multiple of 512 ‚Üí 512 bits.
- Padding procedure: append a single '1' bit, followed by enough zeros to reach 448 bits, then append the original input length as a 64-bit binary number.
- Final padded input length: 512 bits.

| Step | Bit Length | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Original input | 96 | ASCII binary of "red block blue" |
| Append '1' bit | +1 | Single '1' bit appended |
| Append zeros | +440 | Padding zeros to reach 448 bits |
| Append length (64-bit) | +64 | Binary representation of 96 |
| Total | 512 | Padded input length |


***

### üì¶ Step 3: Splitting into Blocks and Words

- The padded input is split into blocks of 512 bits each.
- Since input is exactly 512 bits, there is only one block.
- Each 512-bit block is split into 16 words of 32 bits each.
- These words are labeled m0 through m15.

***

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Initialization of Hash Values (h0 to h7)

- Initialize eight 32-bit hash values h0 through h7.
- These initial values are derived from the fractional parts of the square roots of the first 8 prime numbers.
- Purpose: To ensure a standardized and cryptographically secure starting point.
- Example: h0 = 0x6a09e667, h1 = 0xbb67ae85, etc.
- These constants are fixed and standardized across all SHA-256 implementations.

***

### üî¢ Step 5: Constants k0 to k63

- 64 constants k0 through k63 are used in each compression round.
- Derived from the fractional parts of the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers.
- These constants are fixed and standardized.
- Examples: k0 = 0x428a2f98, k1 = 0x71374491, etc.

***

### üîÑ Step 6: Message Schedule Preparation (w0 to w63)

- Prepare a message schedule array of 64 words (w0 to w63).
- First 16 words (w0 to w15) are the original 32-bit words from the block.
- Remaining words (w16 to w63) are computed iteratively using the formula:

$$
w_t = \sigma_1(w_{t-2}) + w_{t-7} + \sigma_0(w_{t-15}) + w_{t-16} \quad (mod\ 2^{32})
$$

- Where the functions œÉ‚ÇÄ and œÉ‚ÇÅ perform specific bitwise rotations and shifts.

***

### üîç Explanation of ($\sigma_0$) and ($\sigma_1$) Functions

- For a 32-bit word $x$:

| Function | Operations |
| :-- | :-- |
| $\sigma_0(x)$ | $(x \text{ ROTR } 7) \oplus (x \text{ ROTR } 18) \oplus (x \text{ SHR } 3)$ |
| $\sigma_1(x)$ | $(x \text{ ROTR } 17) \oplus (x \text{ ROTR } 19) \oplus (x \text{ SHR } 10)$ |

- ROTR n: rotate right by n bits.
- SHR n: shift right by n bits.
- $\oplus$ denotes bitwise XOR (exclusive OR).

***

### üîÑ Step 7: Compression Loop (t = 0 to 63)

- Initialize working variables (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) with initial hash values h0 to h7.
- For each iteration $t$ from 0 to 63, perform the following calculations:

| Step | Calculation |
| :-- | :-- |
| $T_1$ | $h + \Sigma_1(e) + Ch(e, f, g) + k_t + w_t$ |
| $T_2$ | $\Sigma_0(a) + Maj(a, b, c)$ |
| Update | $h = g,\ g = f,\ f = e,\ e = d + T_1,\ d = c,\ c = b,\ b = a,\ a = T_1 + T_2$ |

- Where:

| Function | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| $\Sigma_0(x)$ | $(x \text{ ROTR } 2) \oplus (x \text{ ROTR } 13) \oplus (x \text{ ROTR } 22)$ |
| $\Sigma_1(x)$ | $(x \text{ ROTR } 6) \oplus (x \text{ ROTR } 11) \oplus (x \text{ ROTR } 25)$ |
| $Ch(x,y,z)$ | Choose function: bitwise selection where bits of $x$ select bits from $y$ or $z$ |
| $Maj(x,y,z)$ | Majority function: bitwise majority of bits among $x, y, z$ |


***

### üîç Details of Choose (Ch) and Majority (Maj) Functions

- Choose (Ch) selects bits from $y$ or $z$ based on $x$: If the bit in $x$ is 1, take the bit from $y$; otherwise, from $z$.
- Majority (Maj) returns the bit that is the majority among the corresponding bits of $x$, $y$, and $z$.

***

### üî¢ Example Calculation for $w_{16}$

- $w_{16} = \sigma_1(w_{14}) + w_9 + \sigma_0(w_1) + w_0 \mod 2^{32}$
- Given many of the $w_i$ values are zero initially, this calculation simplifies.
- Bitwise operations and modulo addition ensure $w_{16}$ retains a 32-bit length.

***

### üîÅ Step 8: Final Hash Value Update

- After completing all 64 rounds, update the hash values as:

$$
h_i = h_i + working\ variable_i \quad \text{for } i=0 \dots 7
$$

- This produces the final hash state.

***

### üèÅ Step 9: Output

- Concatenate the eight 32-bit words $h_0, h_1, \dots, h_7$ to form the complete 256-bit hash.
- Output is typically represented as a hexadecimal string.
- For input "red block blue", the final SHA-256 hash is a unique 64-character hexadecimal value.

- Bitwise operations (rotations, shifts, XOR) are fundamental to the hashing transformations.
- The use of prime number roots ensures good cryptographic diffusion and unpredictability.
- The process is deterministic: the same input always produces the same output.
- The example input is simple, so only one 512-bit block is processed.
